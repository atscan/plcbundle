# Security Model

## Trust Model

PLC Bundle creates an **immutable, cryptographically-chained** archive of PLC directory operations. However, the security depends on external verification.

### What the Chain Provides

✅ **Tamper Evidence**: Any modification breaks the chain
✅ **Integrity Verification**: Detect corruption or tampering
✅ **Reproducibility**: Anyone can recreate bundles from PLC
✅ **Transparency**: All operations are publicly auditable

### What the Chain Does NOT Provide

❌ **Standalone Trust**: The chain alone isn't proof of authenticity
❌ **Protection Against Total Replacement**: Someone controlling all bundles can rewrite history
